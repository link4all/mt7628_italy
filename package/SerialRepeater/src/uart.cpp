       VMIN         Minimum number of characters to read
       VTIME        Time to wait for data (tenths of seconds)

       UNIX serial interface drivers provide the ability to
       specify character and packet timeouts. Two elements of the
       c_cc array are used for timeouts: VMIN and VTIME. Timeouts
       are ignored in canonical input mode or when the NDELAY
       option is set on the file via open or fcntl.

       VMIN specifies the minimum number of characters to read. If
       it is set to 0, then the VTIME value specifies the time to
       wait for every character read. Note that this does not mean
       that a read call for N bytes will wait for N characters to
       come in. Rather, the timeout will apply to the first
       character and the read call will return the number of
       characters immediately available (up to the number you
       request).

       If VMIN is non-zero, VTIME specifies the time to wait for
       the first character read. If a character is read within the
       time given, any read will block (wait) until all VMIN
       characters are read. That is, once the first character is
       read, the serial interface driver expects to receive an
       entire packet of characters (VMIN bytes total). If no
       character is read within the time allowed, then the call to
       read returns 0. This method allows you to tell the serial
       driver you need exactly N bytes and any read call will
       return 0 or N bytes. However, the timeout only applies to
       the first character read, so if for some reason the driver
       misses one character inside the N byte packet then the read
       call could block forever waiting for additional input
       characters.

       VTIME specifies the amount of time to wait for incoming
       characters in tenths of seconds. If VTIME is set to 0 (the
       default), reads will block (wait) indefinitely unless the
       NDELAY option is set on the port with open or fcntl.

       characters are read. That is, once the first character is
       read, the serial interface driver expects to receive an
       entire packet of characters (VMIN bytes total). If no
       character is read within the time allowed, then the call to
       read returns 0. This method allows you to tell the serial
       driver you need exactly N bytes and any read call will
       return 0 or N bytes. However, the timeout only applies to
       the first character read, so if for some reason the driver
       misses one character inside the N byte packet then the read
       call could block forever waiting for additional input
       characters.

       VTIME specifies the amount of time to wait for incoming
       characters in tenths of seconds. If VTIME is set to 0 (the
       default), reads will block (wait) indefinitely unless the
       NDELAY option is set on the port with open or fcntl.
